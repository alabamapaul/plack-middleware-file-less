SYNOPSIS
      use Plack::App::File;
      use Plack::Builder;

      builder {
          mount "/stylesheets" => builder {
              enable "File::Less";
              Plack::App::File->new(root => "./stylesheets");
          };
      };

      # Or with Middleware::Static
      enable "File::Less";
      enable "Static", path => qr/\.css$/, root => "./static";

DESCRIPTION
    Plack::Middleware::File::Less is middleware that compiles Less
    <http://lesscss.org> templates into CSS stylesheet..

    When a request comes in for *.css* file, this middleware changes the
    internal path to *.less* in the same directory. If the LESS template is
    found, a new CSS stylesheet is built on memory and served to the
    browsers. Otherwise, it falls back to the original *.css* file in the
    directory.
